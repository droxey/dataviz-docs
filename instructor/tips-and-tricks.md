# Instructor Tips and Tricks

## Data Analytics and Visualization

### Office Hours

* Have a plan in order to use office hours constructively.

    In my class, Office Hours are structured as follows:

  * **AMA**: Weekdays @ 5:45pm - 6:30pm
  * **Extra Content Sessions**: Weekdays @ 9:30pm - 10pm
  * **Homework Review**: Saturdays @ 9:15am - 10am

### Before Class

* Maintain the Class Repo:
  * Pull latest from the instructor's repository.
  * Push the day's unsolved activities to the class GitLab repository.
  * At the start of class, ask students to `git pull` in order to copy the latest activities locally.

### During Class

* Maintain the Class Repo:
  * Have TAs distribute solved solutions via Slack.
  * Add, commit, and push solved solutions to the class GitLab repository. This helps students get used to the Git paradigm.
